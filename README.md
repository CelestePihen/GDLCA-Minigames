# GDLCA Minigames

**GDLCA Minigames** is a **[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net)** minigames server in the latest version of the game. The server was originally a *survival server* created in April 2022 with my friends and it turned into a **minigames server**.

The server has 4 minigames and event minigames :
- [Hide and Seek](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/cache-cache-plugin)
- [Valocraft](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/valocraft-plugin) (re-creation of the game Valorant made by Riot Games)
- [Parkour](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/parkour-plugin)
- [PVP](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/pvp-plugin)
- [Halloween Event](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/halloween-event-plugin)
- Birthday Event

It also has other plugins to help us like the [API](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/api-plugin) or [Essentials](https://github.com/CelestePihen/GDLCA-Minigames/tree/main/essentials-plugin) (this plugin is used in game)
